#### Getting Started 

We will follow the official GitHub documentation for setting up the repo.

- Forking and cloning the repository

  > [Link to GitHub Docs](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork)

  By forking a repository you create your own copy of the project and make your changes there. Cloning a project means that you are setting up the project on your local system.

- Syncing a fork

  > [Link to GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

  We keep our fork in sync to the original repository so that our copy of the project has the latest changes from the original project.

- Making changes to project and committing a change

  > [Link to docs](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html#commit-your-changes)

  Committing means making changes to the project and adding your changes to the GitHub.

- Making a pull request

  > [Link to docs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

  - Pull request means submitting your changes to the original project for the review. Once the maintainers of the project feel that your changes are appropriate then your pull request will be merged.

* Add relevant commit message in the pr, mention issue number and live link to comment while making pr.

## Guidelines and Instructions

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the maintainer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

- Do not make PR which is not related to any issues. 
  
- You can create an issue and solve it once we approve them.
  
- Follow the PR template strictly. 
  
- If you want to work on any issue, ask us to assign you that issue in comments of particular issue.
  
- If you find any BUG or have some improvement idea, tell us we will create a issue and assign you same issue.
  
- depending upon the time taken and your progress, particular issue can be taken back from you and assigned to others.
  
- Be polite to other contributors members.
